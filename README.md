Welcome to our tutorial learning resource for Spatial Analysis in R! This course is designed to introduce you to the theory and applications of spatial data analysis, covering a wide range of topics from spatial random processes to working with big spatial data.

Throughout the course, you will explore the methodology and modern developments for spatial-temporal modelling, estimation and prediction, and spectral analysis of spatial processes. You will also learn how to apply these techniques in real-world settings, including image analysis and GIS (geographic information system) applications.

Using R as your primary statistical software, you will have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with the analysis of real-world spatial data. By the end of the course, you will have a deep understanding of the essential concepts and techniques of spatial analysis, and be able to apply this knowledge to solve real-world problems.

Whether you are new to spatial analysis or looking to expand your existing knowledge, this tutorial learning resource is an excellent place to start. So let's dive into the fascinating world of spatial analysis in R and unlock new insights into our world!
